# Agent OS

A lightweight operating system for AI agents, based on [buildermethods/agent-os](https://github.com/buildermethods/agent-os). Here I added my own customizations to the original project.

## Agents that build the way you would

[Agent OS](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os) helps you shape better specs, keeps agents aligned in a lightweight system that fits how you already build.

Works alongside Claude Code, Cursor, Antigravity, and other AI tools. Any language, any framework.

**Core capabilities:**

- **Discover Standards** — Extract patterns and conventions from your codebase into documented standards
- **Deploy Standards** — Intelligently inject relevant standards based on what you're building
- **Shape Spec** — Create better plans that lead to better builds
- **Index Standards** — Keep your standards organized and discoverable
